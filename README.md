# Uptime - API Monitoring Tool

Uptime is an API Monitoring Tool that was created using VANILLA NODE.
No Frameworks, No Dependencies, No NPM
A project I embarked on to master Node.js

## Getting Started

- Clone the repo using git clone
- At the top directory create a `.data` directory
- cd into the `.data` directory and create a `users` sub-directory

Still in Progress
